# Building Plugins

Surge is built on a plugin architecture — top-level product areas such as European Power (the ENTSO-E panes), News and the Energy Commodities board are plugins themselves. You can extend the app by writing your own.

> Surge is a fork of Gloomberb. The plugin host contract is inherited unchanged, so this guide still documents Ticker Research tabs and broker adapters; those registration points compile and work, but Surge ships no built-in Ticker Research pane or broker, so they are only useful to plugins that bring their own.

## Installing plugins

Install plugins from GitHub:

```bash
surge install user/repo        # from GitHub shorthand
surge install https://github.com/user/repo  # from full URL
```

Manage installed plugins:

```bash
surge plugins                  # list installed plugins
surge update                   # update all plugins
surge update my-plugin         # update a specific plugin
surge remove my-plugin         # remove a plugin
```

Plugins are installed to `~/.surge/plugins/`.

## Plugin structure

A plugin implements the `SurgePlugin` interface:

```typescript
import type { SurgePlugin } from "surge/types/plugin";

export const myPlugin: SurgePlugin = {
  id: "my-plugin",
  name: "My Plugin",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: "What it does",
  toggleable: true, // let users enable/disable from settings
  cliCommands: [
    {
      name: "my-plugin",
      description: "Run a plugin-owned CLI command",
      async execute(args, ctx) {
        console.log(`args: ${args.join(" ")}`);
      },
    },
  ],

  setup(ctx) {
    // Register tabs, commands, columns, etc.
  },

  dispose() {
    // Cleanup (optional)
  },
};

export default myPlugin;
```

### Built-in plugin composition

Only independently owned, registered product areas implement `SurgePlugin`. Larger built-ins may compose internal `PluginModule` objects for panes, commands, capabilities, and lifecycle code, but those modules do not have their own identity, toggle, version, or persistence namespace. Small plugins such as Substack can declare their contributions directly without an extra module wrapper.

`PluginModule` is an internal organization tool for first-party plugins, not a second external plugin API. External plugins should continue exporting one `SurgePlugin`.

Plugin IDs must not reuse current or retired built-in IDs. Retired module IDs remain reserved so saved configuration can be migrated safely to their current owning plugin.

For external plugins, create a directory in `~/.surge/plugins/`:

```
~/.surge/plugins/my-plugin/
  index.ts          # export default myPlugin
  index.browser.ts  # optional, see below
  package.json      # optional, for dependencies
  icon.svg          # optional, 64x64, shown in the plugin directory
```

### Plugins with a native half

The terminal imports a plugin straight into Bun, so `node:net`, `node:dns`, and
the filesystem are all available. The desktop view and the hosted browser app
are browser contexts: their copy of the plugin is compiled with Bun's browser
target, which **rejects `node:*` imports even behind a dynamic `import()`**. A
plugin that opens a socket or resolves DNS therefore fails to compile for the
view, and the marketplace shows it as broken.

Ship a second, renderer-safe entry for that case:

```json
{
  "main": "index.ts",
  "browser": "index.browser.ts"
}
```

The browser entry exports the same plugin identity, and the same broker
`configSchema` and form conversions, but leaves out anything native. Nothing is
lost on the desktop: the broker's network calls are executed by the Bun process
and reach the view over RPC, so the renderer only needs the metadata and the UI.

`index.browser.ts` is picked up automatically if the `browser` field is absent.
A plugin with no browser entry falls back to `main`, which is correct for the
majority that only use `fetch`.

If a plugin genuinely cannot work on a renderer, declare `targets` instead
(`["cli", "tui"]`, for example) so the marketplace explains why it is inert
rather than reporting a compile error.

### Where plugins run

Plugins run in the terminal and in the desktop app. There is no hosted web
build of Surge; listing `"web"` in `targets` is harmless but has no effect.

## What plugins can do

Use `setup()` for interactive runtime registration, `capabilities` for reusable headless services, and `cliCommands` for root-level CLI commands that should be discoverable without rendering panes. Capability operations can still declare `cli` manifests (`summary`, input/output shape, formats, safety notes, side-effect level) for `surge api list`.

## Headless pane models

A data pane should expose the renderer-neutral model that sits behind its component. Add a `headless` definition to the `PaneDef` and export the definition from the plugin module so server processes can invoke the same loader later. If one pane has multiple templates with different data contracts, put `headless` on each `PaneTemplateDef` instead. A template-level definition takes precedence over the pane-level definition.

```typescript
import type {
  SurgePlugin,
  HeadlessPaneDefinition,
} from "surge/types/plugin";

export const statsHeadless = {
  shape: "bundle",
  argument: {
    kind: "free-text",
    placeholder: "statistic",
    optional: true,
    description: "Optional statistic id or label.",
  },
  options: [{
    key: "range",
    description: "History window.",
    type: "enum",
    values: [{ value: "5Y" }, { value: "20Y" }, { value: "ALL" }],
    defaultValue: "20Y",
  }],
  describe: (args) => `Statistics | ${String(args.options.range)}`,
  async load(args, ctx) {
    const bundle = await loadStatsBundle(ctx.apiClient, ctx.signal);
    return projectStatsView(bundle, args.argument, args.options.range);
  },
} satisfies HeadlessPaneDefinition<"bundle">;

export default {
  id: "stats",
  name: "Statistics",
  version: "1.0.0",
  panes: [{
    id: "stats",
    name: "Statistics",
    component: StatisticsPane,
    defaultPosition: "right",
    headless: statsHeadless,
  }],
} satisfies SurgePlugin;
```

A pane with `headless` automatically gets:

- `surge fn <TOKEN>` text output with shared aligned tables and section headings
- `surge fn <TOKEN> --json` through the normal `{ ok, data }` result envelope
- `reportReadiness: "ready"` plus its declared options in `surge catalog`
- strict option validation for `fn`, including allowed enum values and numeric bounds

The definition is the only structured report contract. Optional `discovery` metadata supplies semantic aliases, a stable capability ID, limitations, and screenshot readiness; the catalog derives argument cardinality and options directly. No central pane capability map or report switch is needed.

### Definition contract

```typescript
interface HeadlessPaneDefinition<Shape extends HeadlessPaneShape> {
  shape: Shape;
  argument: HeadlessPaneArgumentDef;
  options: HeadlessPaneOptionDef[];
  columns?: HeadlessPaneColumn[];
  describe?: string | ((args: HeadlessPaneLoadArgs) => string);
  load(
    args: HeadlessPaneLoadArgs,
    ctx: HeadlessPaneContext,
  ): HeadlessPaneResultByShape[Shape] | Promise<HeadlessPaneResultByShape[Shape]>;
}
```

`argument.kind` is one of `none`, `ticker`, `tickers`, `symbol-list`, or `free-text`. Use `optional`, `minimum`, and `maximum` to describe cardinality. The adapter normalizes ticker arguments and supplies both `args.argument` and `args.symbols`.

Options use the existing pane-function schema: `key`, `type`, `description`, optional aliases, enum `values`, `defaultValue`, and optional integer bounds. Keep option names aligned with pane settings when possible so the same flag can drive a later screenshot model without translation.

`ctx` contains:

- `marketData`: the active plugin-aware market data provider
- `apiClient`: the Surge Cloud client
- `config`: the loaded app configuration
- `signal`: the abort signal for this invocation
- `settings`: effective instance settings after template creation and option normalization
- `resolveInstrument` (optional): resolves a symbol's remembered exchange without exposing storage
- `capabilities` (optional): invokes registered plugin capabilities, including chart series

Headless loaders must stay isomorphic. Do not import React, DOM APIs, Electrobun, OpenTUI, or renderer state. Pass dependencies through `ctx` and keep fetching in `client.ts`.

### Result shapes

The four supported shapes cover the pane catalog:

- `rows`: `{ columns?, rows }` for one table
- `bundle`: `{ sections: [{ title, columns?, rows } | { title, entries }] }` for dashboards such as VAL and ECST
- `series`: `{ series: [{ id, label, points }], stats? }` for charts and derived statistics
- `snapshot`: `{ asOf, items }` for a point-in-time view of a stream

All shapes may include `errors`, `metadata`, and `unavailableSymbols`. Set `unavailableSymbols` for partially missing inputs even when another symbol returns data; otherwise a partial report can incorrectly appear complete. Set `symbols` when the loader expands an expression or adds an implicit peer. Rows and items should contain raw structured values. Put display formatting in column `format` callbacks, or use an entry's `formatted` field, so JSON keeps the raw value while text stays readable.

### Report and screenshot models

Chart templates (`G`, `GP`, `GIP`, `CMP`, `GF`, `GE`) use the same chart resolution engine as the interactive pane. Screenshots render a scoped immutable copy of that resolved model, including transformations, studies, errors, and viewport data. Exporting a chart does not install another plugin capability handler or reload FRED in the webview.

All declared headless `fn` results use `kind: rows | bundle | series | snapshot` and `source: headless`. Financial statements, quotes, historical prices, peer valuation, correlations, and relationships now follow that contract too. Consumers of the former command-specific JSON should read domain details from `rows`, `series`, `stats`, and `metadata`, and use `capabilityId` to identify the command. Chart series retain full OHLCV and observation timestamps in `points`; they are no longer reduced to date/value pairs. Transformed points also retain `rawValue` and the original `rawUnit`, with raw endpoint/return summaries in `metadata.summaries`. Financial series retain per-observation growth. Screenshot evidence keeps its own domain-specific shapes.

### Migration checklist

For a pane that currently fetches inside its component:

1. Move API calls and cache access into `client.ts`. Accept injected clients or providers where practical.
2. Move filtering, grouping, derived values, and row construction into pure functions in `view.ts` or `model.ts`.
3. Make the React pane call those same client and projection functions.
4. Export a typed `headless` definition and attach it to the pane registration, or to each template when one pane has multiple contracts.
5. Declare every supported argument and option. Do not read pane or renderer state from `load`.
6. Verify text, JSON, option errors, and catalog readiness with `surge fn` and `surge catalog`.

## Renderer-neutral UI

Plugins should treat Surge's UI APIs as the renderer contract. Official plugins may render panes, Ticker Research tabs, and slot widgets with React, but plugin UI should import shared Surge APIs such as `surge/ui`, `surge/react`, or the plugin runtime hooks instead of importing OpenTUI, Electrobun, DOM, or terminal renderer packages directly. Renderer-specific details like terminal keyboard events, kitty images, DOM pointer behavior, dialogs, and notifications belong in the renderer adapters.

React plugin panes and Ticker Research tabs are wrapped in a plugin render context. Use plugin runtime hooks for app services from render code.

The `setup()` function receives a context object with these capabilities:

### Registration methods

| Method | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `ctx.registerTickerResearchTab(tab)` | Add a tab to the Ticker Research pane |
| `ctx.registerCommand(cmd)` | Add a command to the command bar |
| `ctx.registerCommandBarSearchProvider(provider)` | Add asynchronous result rows to the command bar (see [Command-bar search providers](#command-bar-search-providers)) |
| `ctx.registerColumn(col)` | Add a custom column to the ticker list |
| `ctx.registerPane(pane)` | Add a full pane (left/right) |
| `ctx.registerPaneTemplate(template)` | Add a reusable pane template (see [Pane templates](#pane-templates)) |
| `ctx.registerBroker(broker)` | Add a broker integration |
| `ctx.registerCapability(capability)` | Add an asset-data, news, or plugin-service capability |
| `ctx.registerShortcut(shortcut)` | Add a global keyboard shortcut |
| `ctx.registerTickerAction(action)` | Add a per-ticker action (shown via `a` key) |
| `ctx.registerContextMenuProvider(provider)` | Add renderer-neutral context menu items |

### Context menus

Plugins can contribute items to native desktop context menus without importing Electrobun, the DOM, or OpenTUI directly. Use Surge APIs from the plugin context, and let the renderer decide whether a native menu is available.

```typescript
ctx.registerContextMenuProvider({
  id: "ticker-tools",
  contexts: ["ticker"],
  order: 10,
  getItems(context) {
    if (context.kind !== "ticker") return null;
    return [{
      id: "my-plugin:open-report",
      label: `Open ${context.symbol} Report`,
      onSelect: () => ctx.openCommandBar(`report ${context.symbol}`),
    }];
  },
});
```

Pane menus receive the pane instance id, pane type, title, and whether the pane is floating:

```typescript
ctx.registerContextMenuProvider({
  id: "pane-tools",
  contexts: ["pane"],
  getItems(context) {
    if (context.kind !== "pane") return null;
    return [{
      id: "my-plugin:focus-pane",
      label: "Focus Pane",
      onSelect: () => ctx.focusPane(context.paneId),
    }];
  },
});
```

Available context kinds are `pane`, `ticker`, `link`, `editable-text`, `selected-text`, `layout`, and `app`. Return `null` or an empty array when your plugin has nothing useful for a context. Keep actions renderer-neutral: call plugin context methods such as `ctx.openCommandBar()`, `ctx.selectTicker()`, `ctx.pinTicker()`, `ctx.focusPane()`, and `ctx.notify()` instead of using renderer-specific APIs.

### Command-bar shortcut discovery

Commands registered with `ctx.registerCommand({ shortcut, shortcutArg })` and pane templates registered with `shortcut` are picked up by the in-app Help pane automatically. Use those fields for user-facing command-bar prefixes instead of adding separate Help text. When a built-in command or pane shortcut is added or renamed, also update the README command tables so the public docs match the live registry.

### Command-bar search providers

`registerCommand` covers actions the user can name. A search provider covers everything else the user might type: it is asked for rows whenever free text stays in the command bar, and answers over the network.

```typescript
setup(ctx) {
  ctx.registerCommandBarSearchProvider({
    id: "my-plugin:documents",
    category: "Documents",   // section heading
    priority: 50,            // higher sinks; navigation sections are negative
    minQueryLength: 3,
    debounceMs: 350,
    async provide(query, context, signal) {
      const hits = await fetchDocuments(query, context.activeTicker, signal);
      return hits.map((hit) => ({
        id: hit.id,
        label: hit.title,
        right: hit.ticker,
        detail: hit.source,
        // Extra rows under the label; matched runs are highlighted.
        lines: [{
          segments: [
            { text: "…margin " },
            { text: "pressure", emphasis: "match" },
            { text: " eased in Q3…", emphasis: "muted" },
          ],
        }],
        execute: () => openDocument(hit),
      }));
    },
  });
}
```

The command bar debounces each provider separately, aborts the request through `signal` as soon as the query moves on, and memoizes answers for as long as the bar is open. Provider rows are added below what the command bar already resolved, so a slow, failing, or empty provider never disturbs the local matches — return an empty array rather than an error row. Rows are capped at two extra lines and truncated to the panel width, and `emphasis` is styled by the theme, so never put markup in `text`.

The returned function withdraws the provider; otherwise it is removed with the plugin.

### CLI commands

Plugins can declare root CLI commands directly on the plugin object with `cliCommands`.

```typescript
import type { SurgePlugin } from "surge/types/plugin";

export const myPlugin: SurgePlugin = {
  id: "my-plugin",
  name: "My Plugin",
  version: "1.0.0",
  cliCommands: [
    {
      name: "my-plugin",
      aliases: ["mp"],
      description: "Run a plugin-owned CLI command",
      help: {
        usage: ["my-plugin run [--limit N]"],
      },
      async execute(args, ctx) {
        if (args[0] !== "run") {
          ctx.fail("Usage: surge my-plugin run");
        }

        const services = await ctx.initServices();
        try {
          ctx.printResult(
            {
              data: [
                { id: "demo", label: `Using data dir ${services.config.dataDir}` },
              ],
            },
            {
              columns: [
                { key: "id", header: "ID" },
                { key: "label", header: "Label" },
              ],
            },
          );
        } finally {
          services.destroy();
        }
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Each CLI command owns one root namespace and parses its own subactions internally. Commands should call shared service/model code or capabilities, not pane React components. Only explicit visual commands such as screenshots should route through pane rendering.

For automation, prefer returning the richest useful structured model in `ctx.printResult({ data })` and use `rows`/`columns` render options to keep text, CSV, and NDJSON compact. JSON output preserves `data` and includes display-column metadata, so agents can inspect both the full model and the human/table projection without scraping terminal text.

Available CLI context helpers:

| Field | What it does |
|------|---------------|
| `ctx.initConfigData()` | Load config, persistence, and ticker storage |
| `ctx.initMarketData()` | Load config plus the plugin-aware asset-data router |
| `ctx.initServices()` | Load the full headless service set, including config, persistence, ticker repository, asset-data router, news service, plugin registry, and capability registry |
| `ctx.cliOptions` | Parsed global flags such as output format, `--limit`, `--refresh`, `--dry-run`, and `--yes` |
| `ctx.printResult(...)` | Render text, JSON, CSV, or NDJSON through the shared CLI result contract |
| `ctx.fail(...)` | Print an error and exit |
| `ctx.closeAndFail(...)` | Close persistence, then print an error and exit |
| `ctx.output.*` | CLI formatting helpers (`cliStyles`, `renderSection`, `renderTable`, `renderStat`, `colorBySign`) |
| `ctx.log` | Scoped debug logger for the owning plugin |

CLI commands may also launch the TUI instead of exiting by returning:

```typescript
return {
  kind: "launch-ui",
  request: {
    applyConfig(config, env) {
      return { config };
    },
  },
};
```

### Data access

| Method | Returns |
|--------|---------|
| `ctx.getData(ticker)` | Cached financials for a ticker |
| `ctx.getTicker(ticker)` | Ticker metadata record |
| `ctx.getConfig()` | Current app config |
| `ctx.marketData` | The active asset-data client |
| `ctx.tickerRepository` | The ticker metadata persistence store |
| `ctx.log` | Scoped logger for debug output |

### Capabilities

Plugins contribute data and services through capabilities. A capability declares its domain, operation names, cache policy, renderer safety, and handlers. The built-in domains in this pass are:

- `asset-data` for quotes, financials, search, FX, price history, options, filings, holders, analyst research, corporate actions, earnings calendars, article summaries, and quote streams.
- `news` for ticker and global news feeds.
- `chart-series` for searchable provider-owned time series that resolve into normal chart data.
- `plugin-service` for narrow renderer-safe service escape hatches.

Capability operations can also include CLI manifest metadata. This is what makes the operation understandable to automation without plugin-specific documentation:

```typescript
{
  kind: "query",
  rendererSafe: true,
  cli: {
    summary: "Fetch a custom research report",
    inputShape: "{ symbol: string }",
    outputShape: "{ symbol, rating, notes }",
    formats: ["text", "json"],
    sideEffectLevel: "none",
    requirements: ["enabled plugin"],
    examples: ['surge api invoke my-plugin.research \'{"symbol":"AAPL"}\' --json'],
  },
  handler: async (input) => ({ symbol: input.symbol, rating: "watch", notes: [] }),
}
```

Use `sideEffectLevel: "local-write"` for local mutations, `"network-write"` for remote writes, `"external-trade"` for order placement/cancel/modify, and `"external-side-effect"` for other irreversible external actions. Mutating CLI commands should support `--dry-run` where practical and require `--yes` for dangerous operations.

```typescript
import { assetDataProvider, newsProvider } from "surge/capabilities";
import type { SurgePlugin } from "surge/types/plugin";

export const myPlugin: SurgePlugin = {
  id: "my-plugin",
  name: "My Plugin",
  version: "1.0.0",
  capabilities: [
    assetDataProvider(myMarketProvider),
    newsProvider({
      id: "my-source",
      name: "My Source",
      priority: 100,
      provider: {
        supports: (query) => query.feed === "ticker",
        fetchNews: async (query) => [],
      },
    }),
  ],

  setup(ctx) {
    ctx.registerCapability(newsProvider({
      id: "my-live-news",
      name: "My Live News",
      provider: { fetchNews: async (query) => [] },
    }));
  },
};
```

### Plugin persistence

Use `ctx.persistence` for local data and cached responses. State stores versioned plugin-local data; resources add cache metadata and TTLs:

```typescript
ctx.persistence.setState("draft", { text: "hello" }, { schemaVersion: 1 });
const draft = ctx.persistence.getState<{ text: string }>("draft", { schemaVersion: 1 });
ctx.persistence.deleteState("draft");

ctx.persistence.setResource("summary", "AAPL", "cached summary", {
  sourceKey: "provider",
  schemaVersion: 1,
  cachePolicy: { staleMs: 3600_000, expireMs: 7 * 24 * 3600_000 },
});

const summary = ctx.persistence.getResource<string>("summary", "AAPL", {
  sourceKey: "provider",
  schemaVersion: 1,
  allowExpired: true,
});

ctx.persistence.deleteResource("summary", "AAPL", { sourceKey: "provider" });
```

### Resume state

Plugin-global resume state persists locally across restarts and is shared by every pane instance. Use it for plugin-wide user data, shared defaults, or transient handoffs that you explicitly delete:

```typescript
ctx.resume.setState("last-provider", "example");
ctx.resume.getState<string>("last-provider");
ctx.resume.deleteState("last-provider");

// Per-pane state belongs to the active layout and can travel with a shared layout.
ctx.resume.setPaneState("my-pane:main", "selectedTab", "news");
ctx.resume.getPaneState<string>("my-pane:main", "selectedTab");
ctx.resume.deletePaneState("my-pane:main", "selectedTab");
```

### Config state (persistent)

Persistent configuration scoped to your plugin. Values are part of the app config system:

```typescript
const apiKey = ctx.configState.get<string>("apiKey");
await ctx.configState.set("apiKey", "sk-...");
await ctx.configState.delete("apiKey");
ctx.configState.keys(); // ["apiKey"]
```

### Navigation

```typescript
ctx.selectTicker("AAPL");              // Select ticker + focus right panel
ctx.selectTicker("AAPL", "my-pane:1"); // Select in a specific pane
ctx.switchPanel("left");               // Switch active panel
ctx.switchTab("chart");                // Switch Ticker Research tab by id
ctx.switchTab("chart", "ticker-research:1"); // Switch tab in a specific pane
ctx.openCommandBar();                  // Open the command bar
ctx.openCommandBar("export");          // Open with a pre-filled query
ctx.openPaneSettings();                // Open settings for the focused pane
ctx.openPaneSettings("my-pane:1");     // Open settings for a specific pane
ctx.showPane("my-pane");               // Show a hidden pane
ctx.hidePane("my-pane");               // Hide a pane
ctx.focusPane("my-pane");              // Move focus to a pane
ctx.pinTicker("AAPL");                 // Open or focus a fixed Ticker Research pane for AAPL
ctx.pinTicker("AAPL", { floating: true, paneType: "ticker-research", forceNewPane: true });
ctx.createPaneFromTemplate("quote-monitor-new", { symbol: "AAPL" });
```

### Broker management

Plugins that register brokers can manage broker instances programmatically:

```typescript
const instance = await ctx.createBrokerInstance("ibkr", "My IBKR", { token: "..." });
await ctx.updateBrokerInstance(instance.id, { token: "new-token" });
await ctx.syncBrokerInstance(instance.id);  // Trigger position import
await ctx.removeBrokerInstance(instance.id);
```

### Pane settings

Panes can expose per-instance settings that persist with the layout. These settings are part of the pane definition, can be edited from the pane header or command bar, and are available to both first-party and external plugins.

Table panes built with the shared `DataTable` can opt into an Excel-compatible CSV action with `tableExport: true`. The action exports the current sorted, filtered rows and visible columns. It is available when the pane has one active table.

```typescript
ctx.registerPane({
  id: "my-pane",
  name: "My Pane",
  component: MyPane,
  defaultPosition: "right",
  tableExport: true,
  settings: {
    title: "My Pane Settings",
    fields: [
      {
        key: "symbol",
        label: "Ticker",
        type: "text",
        placeholder: "AAPL",
      },
      {
        key: "hideTabs",
        label: "Hide Tabs",
        type: "toggle",
      },
      {
        key: "columnIds",
        label: "Columns",
        type: "ordered-multi-select",
        options: [
          { value: "ticker", label: "Ticker" },
          { value: "price", label: "Price" },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

Settings can also be dynamic — pass a function instead of an object to compute fields based on current state:

```typescript
settings: (context) => ({
  title: `Settings for ${context.paneId}`,
  fields: [/* fields based on context.config, context.settings, etc. */],
}),
```

For fields derived from one canonical nested setting, expose their current display values with `values` and map edits back with `applyValue`. The callback returns the complete pane settings object that should be persisted:

```typescript
settings: (context) => ({
  values: {
    mode: context.settings.chartSpec?.mode ?? "line",
  },
  fields: [
    {
      key: "mode",
      label: "Mode",
      type: "select",
      options: [
        { value: "line", label: "Line" },
        { value: "area", label: "Area" },
      ],
    },
  ],
  applyValue: (settings, field, value) => ({
    ...settings,
    chartSpec: {
      ...settings.chartSpec,
      [field.key]: value,
    },
  }),
}),
```

Available field types:
- `toggle`
- `text`
- `select`
- `multi-select`
- `ordered-multi-select`

Imperative pane settings access is available on the plugin context:

```typescript
const symbol = ctx.paneSettings.get<string>("quote-monitor:main", "symbol");
await ctx.paneSettings.set("quote-monitor:main", "symbol", "MSFT");
await ctx.paneSettings.delete("quote-monitor:main", "symbol");
```

Inside pane components, use `usePaneSettingValue()` to read and update the current pane's persisted settings:

```typescript
import { usePaneSettingValue } from "surge/components";

function MyPane() {
  const [hideTabs, setHideTabs] = usePaneSettingValue("hideTabs", false);
  // ...
}
```

### Portable pane sharing

Published layouts copy a pane's title, params, settings, and per-layout pane state by default. Credentials, account and portfolio identifiers, local paths, and other sensitive key names are rejected automatically. Declare the remaining pane-specific private fields beside the pane definition:

```typescript
ctx.registerPane({
  id: "portfolio-risk",
  name: "Portfolio Risk",
  component: PortfolioRiskPane,
  defaultPosition: "right",
  portableShare: {
    private: {
      params: ["portfolioId"],
      settings: ["accountId"],
      state: ["bankroll", "positions"],
    },
  },
});
```

Use `true` instead of an array to keep a whole scope local. Set `title: true` when the title can identify a private channel or account. Plugin-global resume/config/resource state is never copied. State that should travel with a layout or pane share belongs in `usePluginPaneState()` or `usePaneSettingValue()`, not `usePluginState()`. Share Pane applies this projection automatically; `PaneTemplateDef.publicShare` remains only for old v1 links or deliberate transformed snapshots.

### Pane quick settings

A pane can surface important toggle settings next to its title. Each quick setting references a `toggle` field from the pane's normal settings definition, so the header control and settings dialog share the same persisted value and update behavior.

```typescript
ctx.registerPane({
  id: "live-prices",
  name: "Live Prices",
  component: LivePricesPane,
  defaultPosition: "right",
  quickSettings: [
    { type: "toggle", key: "liveStreaming", icon: "zap" },
  ],
  settings: (context) => ({
    values: {
      liveStreaming: context.settings.liveStreaming !== false,
    },
    fields: [
      {
        key: "liveStreaming",
        label: "Live streaming",
        description: "Stream updates continuously when enabled.",
        type: "toggle",
      },
    ],
  }),
});

function LivePricesPane() {
  const [liveStreaming] = usePaneSettingValue("liveStreaming", true);
  // Use liveStreaming to select continuous updates or a slower polling path.
}
```

Quick settings currently support toggle fields with the `zap` icon. Unknown keys and non-toggle fields are ignored.

### Events

Subscribe to and emit app events:

```typescript
ctx.on("ticker:selected", ({ symbol, previous }) => {
  console.log(`Selected ${symbol}`);
});

ctx.on("ticker:refreshed", ({ symbol, financials }) => {
  // React to new data
});

// Plugins can also emit events
ctx.emit("ticker:selected", { symbol: "AAPL", previous: null });
```

Available events: `ticker:selected`, `ticker:refreshed`, `ticker:added`, `ticker:removed`, `config:changed`, `plugin:registered`, `plugin:unregistered`.

### App notifications

```typescript
ctx.notify({
  title: "Chat mention",
  body: "@bob mentioned you",
  desktop: "when-inactive", // desktop only when the terminal loses focus
});

ctx.notify({ body: "Saved successfully", type: "success" });
ctx.notify({ body: "Something went wrong", type: "error", duration: 5000 });
ctx.notify({ body: "FYI..." }); // defaults to an in-app info toast
```

### Floating panes

Panes with `defaultMode: "floating"` open as draggable/resizable floating windows:

```typescript
import { Box, Text } from "surge/ui";

ctx.registerPane({
  id: "my-pane",
  name: "My Pane",
  component: ({ paneId, paneType, width, height, focused, close }) => (
    <Box flexDirection="column" width={width} height={height}>
      <Text>Hello from pane!</Text>
    </Box>
  ),
  defaultPosition: "right",
  defaultMode: "floating",
  defaultFloatingSize: { width: 40, height: 10 },
});

// Show/hide as floating window programmatically
ctx.showPane("my-pane");
ctx.hidePane("my-pane");
```

### Pane templates

Pane templates let users create new pane instances from the command bar. This is useful when a plugin supports multiple independent instances (e.g., multiple chart panes for different tickers):

```typescript
ctx.registerPaneTemplate({
  id: "my-chart-new",
  paneId: "my-chart",       // references a registered pane
  label: "New Chart",
  description: "Open a new chart pane",
  keywords: ["chart", "new"],

  // Optional: command-bar shortcut prefix (e.g., typing "/chart AAPL")
  shortcut: {
    prefix: "/chart",
    argPlaceholder: "ticker",
    argKind: "ticker",
  },

  // Optional: wizard steps shown before creating the pane
  wizard: [
    { key: "interval", label: "Interval", type: "select", options: [
      { label: "1D", value: "1d" },
      { label: "1W", value: "1w" },
    ]},
  ],

  // Optional: control when the template is available
  canCreate(context, options) {
    return !!options?.symbol;
  },

  // Configure the new pane instance
  createInstance(context, options) {
    return {
      title: options?.symbol ?? "Chart",
      settings: { symbol: options?.symbol },
      binding: options?.symbol ? { kind: "fixed", symbol: options.symbol } : undefined,
    };
  },
});
```

Create pane instances programmatically:

```typescript
ctx.createPaneFromTemplate("my-chart-new", { symbol: "AAPL" });
```

## Reusable components

Import basic UI from `surge/components`, layout and specialized rendering primitives from `surge/ui`, hooks from `surge/react`, colors from `surge/theme`, and formatters from `surge/utils`:

```typescript
import { Box } from "surge/ui";
import { Button, DataTableView, PaneStatusBody, Section, KeyValueRow, usePaneFooter } from "surge/components";
import { usePaneTicker, usePluginPaneState } from "surge/react";
import { colors, priceColor } from "surge/theme";
import { formatCurrency, formatNumber } from "surge/utils";
```

Choose the existing control that owns the interaction you need:

| Need | Components |
|------|------------|
| Sortable/selectable rows | `DataTableView`, `TickerListTableView` |
| Table with a detail stack | `DataTableStackView`, `FeedDataTableStackView` |
| Charts | `StaticChartSurface`, `MetricTreemapSurface`, `SpeedometerGauge` |
| Navigation and choices | `Tabs`, `SegmentedControl`, `SelectButton`, `Checkbox` |
| Actions and inputs | `Button`, `TextField`, `NumberField`, `InputSearchBar` |
| Clickable/expandable summaries | `ActionRow` |
| Selectable lists | `ListView` |
| Dialog content | `DialogFrame`, `ChoiceDialog`, `ConfirmDialog`, `PriceSelectorDialog` |
| Section and document headings | `Section`, `SectionHeading` (`wrap` for long headings) |
| Labeled values and badges | `KeyValueRow`, `Badge` |
| Paragraphs and separators | `Prose`, `Divider` |
| Loading, empty states, inline feedback | `Spinner`, `EmptyState`, `PaneStatusBody`, `Notice` |
| External links | `ExternalLink`, `ExternalLinkText` |
| Sidebar | `PaneSidebar`, `PaneSidebarRow`, `PaneSidebarAction` |

[The component exports](src/components/index.ts) are the complete public surface, including the entire basic UI kit. Built-in and external panes must use these components for basic UI. Shared components own appearance, theme updates, focus, keyboard/mouse behavior, disabled state, and automation semantics. A pane supplies its data and domain behavior.

Use `Box` and `ScrollBox` to arrange content. Custom chart surfaces, order-book visualizations, rich inline ticker content, and specialized editors can use lower-level primitives. Do not recreate a button with a clickable `Box`, a section heading with styled `Text`, or a field with raw `Input`. Add a missing repeated pattern to the kit and migrate the callers together. Keep domain calculations and formatting with the pane.

`Button` supports a compact layout and a separate `displayLabel` for short/icon actions; `label` remains the full accessible and automation name. Use `stopPropagation` for actions nested inside a row. `ActionRow` owns an expandable row's interaction and disclosure affordance. `SelectButton` chooses a native select or terminal dialog internally; a `SelectControl` ref can open it without knowing the renderer.

`PaneStatusBody` replaces the body only when the caller passes a loading, error, or empty state. Preserve existing data during refresh by passing `loading={loading && !data}` and `error={!data ? error : null}`. Use `Notice` for inline refresh errors. It supports centered states, custom loading labels, and retry `actions`:

```tsx
<PaneStatusBody loading={loading && !data} error={!data ? error : null}
  empty={!loading && !error && !data} subject="research" align="center"
  actions={<Button label="Try again" onPress={reload} />}>
  <Section title="Valuation">
    <KeyValueRow label="P/E" value={formattedPE} />
  </Section>
</PaneStatusBody>
```

Use `usePaneSettingValue(key, fallback)` from `surge/react` for persistent pane settings and `usePaneTitle(title)` for a content-derived pane title. They update the active saved layout without requiring direct app-config writes. Both accept an optional explicit pane ID.

Pane footers show changing status such as loading, errors, stale data, or live/delayed feeds. Do not repeat the pane title, fixed labels, row counts, or generic keyboard hints:

```typescript
usePaneFooter("my-pane", () => ({
  info: loading
    ? [{ id: "loading", parts: [{ text: "loading", tone: "muted" }] }]
    : error ? [{ id: "error", parts: [{ text: error, tone: "warning" }] }] : [],
}), [loading, error]);
```

### Plugin runtime hooks

These hooks are available inside pane and tab components rendered by a plugin. They provide app actions, asset data access, and reactive access to the plugin's storage layers:

```typescript
import {
  useAssetData,
  useMarketData,
  usePluginPaneState,
  usePluginState,
  usePluginConfigState,
  usePluginTickerActions,
  usePluginAppActions,
} from "surge/react";

const marketData = useMarketData();
const assetData = useAssetData();
const { navigateTicker, pinTicker } = usePluginTickerActions();
const { openCommandBar, showPane, hidePane, notify } = usePluginAppActions();

// Per-pane layout state (scoped to the current pane instance)
const [expanded, setExpanded] = usePluginPaneState("expanded", false);

// Persistent plugin state (survives restarts)
const [cache, setCache] = usePluginState("cache", null, { schemaVersion: 1 });

// Plugin config state (persistent, part of app config)
const [apiKey, setApiKey] = usePluginConfigState("apiKey", "");
```

## Pane props

Pane components receive these props:

```typescript
interface PaneProps {
  paneId: string;    // unique instance id (e.g., "my-pane:main")
  paneType: string;  // pane definition id (e.g., "my-pane")
  focused: boolean;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  close?: () => void;  // present for closeable panes
}
```

## Ticker Research tab props

Tab components receive these props:

```typescript
interface TickerResearchTabProps {
  width: number;
  height: number;
  focused: boolean;
  onCapture(capturing: boolean): void;
}
```

Call `onCapture(true)` when your tab needs exclusive keyboard input (e.g., a text editor or chat input) and `onCapture(false)` when done, so global shortcuts keep working.

Ticker Research tabs can control their visibility based on the current ticker:

```typescript
ctx.registerTickerResearchTab({
  id: "options",
  name: "Options",
  order: 50,
  component: OptionsTab,
  isVisible({ ticker, financials, hasOptionsChain }) {
    return hasOptionsChain;
  },
});
```

## Example: adding a Ticker Research tab

The simplest plugin type. This adds a new tab to the Ticker Research pane:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { Box, Text } from "surge/ui";
import type { SurgePlugin, TickerResearchTabProps } from "surge/types/plugin";
import { EmptyState, usePaneTicker } from "surge/components";
import { colors } from "surge/theme";

function SentimentTab({ width, height, focused }: TickerResearchTabProps) {
  const { ticker } = usePaneTicker();
  if (!ticker) {
    return (
      <EmptyState
        title="No ticker selected."
        hint="Move the cursor in a list pane to populate this tab."
      />
    );
  }

  return (
    <Box flexDirection="column" width={width} height={height}>
      <Box height={1}>
        <Text fg={colors.text}>{`Sentiment for ${ticker.metadata.ticker}`}</Text>
      </Box>
      <Box height={1} />
      <Box flexDirection="row" height={1}>
        <Text fg={colors.textDim}>Signal  </Text>
        <Text fg={colors.positive}>Bullish</Text>
      </Box>
      <Box flexDirection="row" height={1}>
        <Text fg={colors.textDim}>Trend   </Text>
        <Text fg={colors.text}>Improving</Text>
      </Box>
    </Box>
  );
}

export default {
  id: "sentiment",
  name: "Sentiment",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: "View market sentiment for each ticker",
  toggleable: true,
  setup(ctx) {
    ctx.registerTickerResearchTab({
      id: "sentiment",
      name: "Sentiment",
      order: 60,
      component: SentimentTab,
    });
  },
} satisfies SurgePlugin;
```

## UI guidelines for plugins

- Basic UI must use the shared components listed above. Extend the kit for a missing reusable pattern.
- Support both mouse and keyboard for anything interactive.
- Put changing pane status in `usePaneFooter()`. Keep keyboard hints on their shared controls; do not add fixed footer labels, row counts, or generic hints.
- Use `colors` and the shared components instead of hard-coded palette values when possible.
- Use `usePaneTicker()` inside pane/tab components so multi-pane layouts keep working correctly.

## Example: adding a command

```typescript
setup(ctx) {
  ctx.registerCommand({
    id: "export-csv",
    label: "Export to CSV",
    keywords: ["export", "csv", "download"],
    category: "data",
    description: "Export current portfolio as CSV",
    async execute() {
      // your logic here
      ctx.notify({ body: "Exported!", type: "success" });
    },
  });
}
```

Commands can also define a multi-step wizard flow:

```typescript
ctx.registerCommand({
  id: "set-alert",
  label: "Set Price Alert",
  keywords: ["alert", "notify"],
  category: "data",
  wizard: [
    { key: "price", label: "Alert price", type: "text" },
    { key: "direction", label: "Direction", type: "select", options: [
      { label: "Above", value: "above" },
      { label: "Below", value: "below" },
    ]},
  ],
  wizardLayout: "form",  // "steps" (default) or "form" (all fields at once)
  async execute(values) {
    // values.price, values.direction
  },
});
```

Wizard step types: `text`, `password`, `number`, `select`, `info`. Steps can use `dependsOn` to conditionally appear based on a previous step's value.

Commands can require confirmation before executing:

```typescript
ctx.registerCommand({
  id: "delete-all",
  label: "Delete All Notes",
  keywords: ["delete", "notes"],
  category: "data",
  confirm: {
    title: "Delete all notes?",
    body: ["This cannot be undone."],
    confirmLabel: "Delete",
    tone: "danger",
  },
  async execute() { /* ... */ },
});
```

Commands can be conditionally hidden:

```typescript
ctx.registerCommand({
  id: "admin-tool",
  label: "Admin Tool",
  keywords: ["admin"],
  category: "config",
  hidden: () => !ctx.getConfig().debugMode,
  async execute() { /* ... */ },
});
```

## Example: adding a custom column

```typescript
setup(ctx) {
  ctx.registerColumn({
    id: "conviction",
    label: "Conv.",
    width: 6,
    align: "right",
    render(ticker, financials) {
      const score = ticker.metadata?.custom?.conviction ?? "-";
      return String(score);
    },
  });
}
```

## Example: keyboard shortcut

```typescript
setup(ctx) {
  ctx.registerShortcut({
    id: "my-shortcut",
    key: "s",
    ctrl: true,
    description: "Save snapshot",
    execute() {
      // your logic
      ctx.notify({ body: "Snapshot saved" });
    },
  });
}
```

## Example: ticker action

```typescript
setup(ctx) {
  ctx.registerTickerAction({
    id: "open-in-browser",
    label: "Open in Yahoo Finance",
    keywords: ["open", "yahoo", "browser"],
    // Optional: only show for certain tickers
    filter: (ticker) => ticker.metadata.exchange === "US",
    execute(ticker, financials) {
      // open URL...
    },
  });
}
```

Ticker actions appear when pressing `a` with a ticker selected.

## Status widgets

`status:widget` renders in the status bar and receives the same plugin runtime context as panes and tabs. Its function can use runtime hooks:

```typescript
slots: {
  "status:widget": StatusWidget,
},
```

Other historical `SurgeSlots` names have no render sites. Use the explicit registration methods for ticker tabs, columns, commands, events, and capabilities.

## Tips

- Look at the built-in plugins in `src/plugins/builtin/` for real-world examples
- Use `order` on Ticker Research tabs to control position (core tabs use 10, 20, 30)
- Toggleable plugins can be enabled/disabled by users from settings (`Ctrl+,`)
- The terminal renderer is backed by [OpenTUI](https://opentui.com/) packages such as `@opentui/core` and `@opentui/react`; plugin UI should stay on `surge/ui` and `surge/components`
- Use `ctx.persistence` for cached resources, `ctx.resume` for local resume state, and `ctx.configState` for configuration
- Use `ctx.on()` to react to app events without polling
- Use `ctx.notify()` for non-intrusive user feedback and desktop notifications
