/**
 * Test helpers for external plugin repositories (`surge/test-support`).
 *
 * Plugins live in their own repos and run their own `bun test`, so the fakes and
 * render harness they need have to ship with the host rather than being copied
 * per plugin and drifting.
 *
 * The harness is OpenTUI-backed. That is the host's business, not the plugin's:
 * a plugin importing a renderer package directly stops working on the other
 * renderers, which is exactly what going through this module avoids.
