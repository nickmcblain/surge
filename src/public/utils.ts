/**
 * Public utility surface for external plugins (`surge/utils`).
 *
 * Everything re-exported here is a compatibility commitment: plugins in other
 * repositories import it, so removing or changing a signature is a breaking
 * change for them. Internal helpers stay internal — add to this barrel only
 * when a real plugin needs it, and prefer widening later over exporting
 * speculatively.
 *
 * `scripts/check-public-api.ts` pins the exported names so the surface cannot
 * grow by accident during an unrelated refactor.
