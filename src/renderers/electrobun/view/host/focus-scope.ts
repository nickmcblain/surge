/**
 * The browser gives up a field's focus when you press somewhere else. Panes,
 * charts and rows all consume their own mousedown, which is exactly what
 * suppresses that, so a field can hold the keyboard long after it looks done.
 *
 * One rule restores the default: a press outside the widget that owns the focus
 * releases it. Widgets whose own chrome must not take focus from their field,
 * such as a suggestion list under an input, mark it with the scope attribute.
 *
 * A dialog is exempt. It owns the pointer while it is open, and releasing a
 * field underneath it re-renders whatever hosts the dialog, which costs the
 * dialog the focus it just took.
